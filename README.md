Knitout is a file format for representing low-level knitting instructions in a machine-independent way.

The [specification](./knitout.html) documents the format.

##Contributing

The specification cannot evolve without your help.
If you have suggestions, comments, or revisions please don't hesitate to add them to the [Issues](https://github.com/textiles-lab/knitout/issues) page.
